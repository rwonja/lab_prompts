# Lab Creation Workflow

## Overview
I have taken to using the `lab_context.md` context file (included in this repo) to provide the AI (currently using Claude Code) with context regarding the overall considerations for the course.

After pulling that file and any other content (see Socratic Shell below) into context with the agent, we generally discuss the topic which we are looking to create a lab for, and have a conversation about the learning objectives, the structure of the lab, and any specific requirements or constraints. We try to investigate all of the considerations for students and for technical implementation before we actually begin creating the lab. Once we've got a good plan, I let the AI create the initial lab content. After this I go through and test everything, making edits and adjustments as needed.

## Socratic Shell
[Socratic Shell Github Repo](https://github.com/onja-org/w2_css_intro_to_animation)  
[Socratic Shell Documentation](https://socratic-shell.github.io/socratic-shell/)  
[Socratic Shell Quickstart](https://socratic-shell.github.io/socratic-shell/installation.html)

I have found this approach to be great in setting a collaborative and thoughtful tone with the AI agent.

Essentially all it does is add a line to your user-wide CLAUDE.md file that pulls in a contextual conversation about collaborating mindfully, which helps the agent keep from rushing into generating content before all considerations have been discussed.
